## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MSIConverter.git
   cd MSIConverter
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Install Pre-commit Hooks** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "not integration"
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

### Formatting
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### Linting
- **flake8** for code linting
- **bandit** for security checks

### Type Hints
- Use type hints for all public functions
- Follow PEP 484 conventions

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .

# Run linting
poetry run flake8

# Run security checks
poetry run bandit -r msiconvert/
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** - Fast tests for individual functions
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "unit"
   ```

2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow tests
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "integration"
   ```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
- Run tests with coverage:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest --cov=msiconvert --cov-report=html
  ```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_convert_imzml_when_valid_file_provided`
- Mark tests appropriately: `@pytest.mark.unit` or `@pytest.mark.integration`

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow code style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   poetry run black .
   poetry run isort .
   poetry run flake8
   poetry run pytest
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commit format when possible:
     ```
     feat: add dry-run mode for conversion preview
     fix: resolve memory leak in large dataset processing
     docs: update installation instructions
     ```

### Submitting the Pull Request
